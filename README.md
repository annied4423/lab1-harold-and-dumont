# Lab 1

**Due:** Mon Feb 1, 10am

## Problem

Write a program that asks the user for a number of milliliters (mL) and outputs the equivalent number of teaspoons and tablespoons. **Note:** Assume there are (rounding up) 5mL in a teaspoon and 3 teaspoons in a tablespoon.

## Instructions

1. Create **test cases** (see section below). 
2.	Create a new Python file and include **intro comments** at the top of your .py file (template below).
3. **Use comments to write the algorithm** your program will follow.
4.	Write the Python **code** corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
5.	**Test** your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
6.	**Commit** and **push** changes and check github.com to confirm the update before leaving lab (even if not finished).

### Test Cases

Create an Excel File with at least five test cases. Use one row per test case with columns for input, output 1, and output 2. Use a calculator if needed to compute the outputs. The following provides the first test and hints for the remaining four.

1. Simple non-zero situation: Input: 1ml, Output Teaspoons: 0.2, Output Tablespoons: 0.066667
2. Zero as input
3. Case giving exactly 1 teaspoon as result 
4. Case giving exactly 1 tablespoon as result 
5. Large number of teaspoons and tablespoons

## Submission
